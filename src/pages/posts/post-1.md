# My First Blog Post Using Astro

published on: 29-06-2023

Welcome to my first blog post, I'm in Alexandria at the moment and using my cousin's computer and running Windows and VScode (Which I hate so much), at least I'm using Vim keybinds :).

# What I've accomplished

- Learnt how to install `npm` and `astro` on Windows
- Explored the basics of Astro

# What's Next

- I will finish this Astro tutorial hopefully before returning to Cairo!
